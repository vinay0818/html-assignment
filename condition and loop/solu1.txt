Conditional Statements: 

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 

The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
ex- Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18;

if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
The result of greeting will be:Good day; 

The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false. 
example- If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":

if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
} 
The result of greeting will be:Good evening; 

The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
Example -If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting, if not, but time is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening":

if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
The result of greeting will be:

Good evening;
