JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
Often this is the case when working with arrays: 

Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
The For Loop; 

The For Loop
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
} 

The For In Loop
The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:

Syntax
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}  

The For Of Loop
The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

Syntax
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}  
 
The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
